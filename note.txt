\section*{Forward Direction}

Assume $\phi(t)$ is a solution to the IVP. This means it satisfies the differential equation and the initial condition. We need to show the three conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[i)] $(t, \phi(t)) \in U$ for all $t \in I$: This follows from the fact that $\phi(t)$ is a solution, and solutions should remain within the domain of $f(t, x)$.
  
  \item[ii)] $\phi$ is continuous on $I$: This can be shown using the continuity of $f(t, x)$ and standard results on the continuity of solutions to ODEs.
  
  \item[iii)] $\phi(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, \phi(s)) \, ds$: This follows from the integral form of the solution.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Backward Direction}

Assume the conditions i), ii), and iii) are satisfied. We need to show that $\phi(t)$ is a solution to the IVP:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[a)] Show that $\phi(t)$ satisfies the differential equation $\frac{d\phi}{dt} = f(t, \phi(t))$ for all $t \in I$.
  
  \item[b)] Show that $\phi(t_0) = x_0$.
\end{enumerate}

These steps would involve using the given conditions, properties of continuous functions, and properties of integrals to establish that $\phi(t)$ is indeed a solution to the given IVP.

\noindent \textbf{(⇒)} Let us suppose that $\phi' = f(t, \phi)$ for all $t \in I$ and that $\phi(t_0) = x_0$. Then for all $t \in I$, $(t, \phi(t)) \in U$ (i). Also, $\phi$ is differentiable and thus continuous on $I$ (ii). Finally,
\[\phi'(s) = f(s, \phi(s))\]
so integrating both sides from $t_0$ to $t$,
\[\phi(t) - \phi(t_0) = \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, \phi(s)) \, ds\]
and thus
\[\phi(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, \phi(s)) \, ds\]
hence (iii).

\noindent \textbf{(⇐)} Assume i), ii), and iii). Then $\phi$ is differentiable on $I$, and $\phi'(t) = f(t, \phi(t))$ for all $t \in I$.
From (iii), $\phi(t_0) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, \phi(s)) \, ds = x_0$.

Note that Theorem 1.1.8 states that $\phi$ should be continuous, whereas the solution should, of course, be $C^1$, for its derivative needs to be continuous. However, this is implied by point iii). In fact, more generally, the following result holds about the regularity of solutions.
